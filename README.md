This is an adaption of an early React to-do list app (as introduced in the React course on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, but built according to my own idiosyncrasies). In this adaption, I have added in TypeScript and worked a little bit more on the filters, so as to ensure that, for example, the order of display is always chronologically correct. The app still has plenty of room for development (for example, the content adder and content changer components could and probably should be turned into a custom component), but my aim at this stage has simply been to get better used to using TypeScript in React.
